# Pose Estimation
Pose estimation can be approached in bottom-up methods in which different body parts are detected and then parts of the same person are associated to form human poses. Bottom-up methods are robust to early commitment but fail to effectively utilize global context. Top-down methods, which firstly generate region proposals and then estimate poses, are vulnerable to detection errors.

The major challenge of top-down approaches is to locate and recognize poses simultaneously. However, even state-of-the-artHuman detectors produce localization error redundant proposals, [1] proposes RMPE to make SPEE more robust.   

It uses STN that perform affine transformations to improve quality of proposals. Pose estimations are then generated and re-mapping to the original input. Spatial re-mapping highway is utilized to speedup the learning process of STN.

STN is trained by dataset generated by a deep proposal generator, where a dizygotic-Siamese network is adopted to predict scores of randomly generated proposals. High-scored proposals are chosen to train STN.  

Pose-NMS is applied as the final step, which the distance function is comprised of the soft-matching function and the spacial distance.
